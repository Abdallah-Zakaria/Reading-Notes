## Comparison operators:
evaluate a situation by comparing  give you boolean result True or False.
- equal to '==' check if it's the same.
- not equal to '!=' check if it's not the same.
- strict equal to '===' check if the both data type and value are the same.
- strict not equal to '!==' check if the both value is not the same .
- greater than '>' check if the number on the left is greater than the right number.
- less than '<' check if the number on the left is less than the right number
- greater than or equal to '>=' same as the greater than and give more chance to check if it equal to
- less than or equal to ' <=' same as the less than and give more chance to check if it equal to

## Logicalo operators:
it's to compare the reuslts of more than one comparison operator.
__Example on logical operator__ : ((6<3) && (4>=5))
- logical AND '&&' check more than one condition.
- logical OR '||' check at least one condition.
- logical NOT '!' check if not equal to.


## Loops
loops check a condition, and stay do it until the condition get false.
#### Type of loops
For loop 
- here the condition is counter which you know the specific number of repeats
- for loop use counter and condition
- the code run specified number of times.
- for loop comtent three statements initalization, condition and update.

While loop 
- if you don't know how many times the cood should run , then use the while loop,  there is no counter in this loop.

Do while loop 
- same as while loop, but its always run the code one time befor start the check the condition .
