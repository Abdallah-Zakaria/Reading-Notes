#### How we write CSS 
CSS don't work without assoiating with HTML elements.
The CSS contanins two main parts the __selector__ and the __declaration__.
- The __selector__  target the elements, you can target more than one using commas
- The __declaration__ the style that will apply to the selector, and its split into two parts inside the curly brackets: the __property__ and the __value__ are separated by a colon, ether you can ass several properties in one  declaration by separated them using semi-colon.
- __Properties__ indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.
- __Values__ specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. 

## Color in CSS
 You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
- __rgb values__ : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.  For example: rgb(100,100,90)
- __hex codes__ : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
- __color names__ : There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan
