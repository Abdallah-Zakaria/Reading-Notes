## Introducing CSS
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
Block  elements look like they start on a new line, inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new.

###### CSS rule contain
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
- __Selectors__ indicate which element the rule applies to.
- __Declarations__ indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. 
 - Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change.
 - Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties.

 ###### External and Internal using of CSS
- External :
  -  <link> tell the browser where to find the CSS file.
  -  href specifies the path to the CSS file.
  - type specifies the type of document being linked to.
  - rel specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to.
- Internal : placing the CSS inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page. 


## Basic javascript instructions
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one, each individual instruction or step is known as a statement, statements should end with a semicolon.
In javascript there are two way for add comments:
- using /* your comment */ its a multi-line comments.
- using // first of the line will comment all the line.

###### What is a Variable
 A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 
A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 
__How to declare variables__
You need to announce that you want to ise it, this involves creating the variable and giving it a name.
Once yo have created a variable, you can tell it what information you would like to store for you.
__Data Type__
There is three main data type :
- numeric data type : The numeric data type handles numbers. 
- string data type : The strings data type consists of letters and other characters. 
- boolean data type : Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false. 

###### Rule for naming variables
- The name must begin witha letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number. 
- you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name. 
- You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
- All variables are case sensitive, as using different cases.
-  describes the kind of information that the variable stores. 
- If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
