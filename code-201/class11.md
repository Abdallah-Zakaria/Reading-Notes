## Practical Information
### SEO
Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
Ensuring that any images have appropriate text in the value of their alt attribute also helps search engines understand the content of images.
Search engines also look at the words between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than just click here or your website address) it may be considered more relevant.
