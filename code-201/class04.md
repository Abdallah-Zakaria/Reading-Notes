## links
When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.
If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page.
Every page and every image on a website has a URL (or Uniform Resource Locator). The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the path to that page or image.
#### The root folder contains:
- A file called index.html which
is the homepage for the entire site.
- Individual folders for the movies, music and theatre sections of the site.
#### Each sub-directory contains:
- A file called index.html which is the homepage for that section.
- A reviews page called reviews .html.
- A listings page called listings .html (except for the DVD section).
#### The movies section contains:
- A folder called cinema.
- A folder called DVD.

#### mailto:
Starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
looks just like any other link but, when it is clicked on, the user's email program will open a new email message and address it to the person specified in the link.

## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.
To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors. 
#### Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
A box may be nested inside several other block-level elements. The containing element is always the direct parent of that element.
