## Solving Problems
#### A simple set of steps
The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.

- “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness
- “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”
- “Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations…If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.”
- “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss
- “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”
- “As a man thinketh, so is he. As he continues to think, so he remains.” -James Allen
- People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.”
- “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet
- “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”
